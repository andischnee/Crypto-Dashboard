# Crypto-Dashboard
We implemented an interactive dashboard for the following crypto currencies: 
"Cardano, Cosmos, Avalanche, Axie Infinity, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink, Terra, Polygon and Solana."
The dashboard will allow an interactive observation for three different sections and views for the user. In this dashboard, we created two types of filters, one categorical and one temporal. The categorical filtering allows a separate view between the 10 cryptocurrencies using a dropdown. The second one consists of 2 temporal buttons: “Start Date” and “End Date” which allows for a detailed analysis of a specific time period and interacting like a calendar.
